https://morning-cliffs-77264.herokuapp.com/

### What is this App?

A web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news utilizing Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

### How does it work?

  1. express

  2. express-handlebars

  3. mongoose

  4. cheerio

  5. axios

Whenever a user visits the site, the app should scrape stories from NYTimes and display them for the user. Each scraped article will be saved to an application database. The app should scrape and display the following information for each article:

     * Headline - the title of the article

     * Summary - a short summary of the article

     * URL - the url to the original article

#How is it used?

Users should be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments should be saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users should also be able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments should be visible to every user.

#Who will use it?

The app is for classwork using MongoDB, Mongoose, and scraping, but anyone is welcome to view and explore the code.
